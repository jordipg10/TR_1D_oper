This version of the code has been tested with the following examples, which can be found in the repository:
1) Gypsum in equilibrium
2) Gypsum not in equilibrium
3) 2 mineral zones (calcite & anhydrite) in equilibrium
4) 2 mineral zones (calcite & anhydrite) not in equilibrium
5) Denitrification with only 2 redox reactions
6) Denitrification with the whole redox sequence, as well as anammox and sulfammox

The executable is found in the file "main.exe".

The sequence of commands for the client is as follows:
1) Write path for databases
2) Write path with root of the problem to be solved
3) Choose option to compute mixing ratios. If client wishes to compute them, then choose integration method for chemical reactions.

Important note regarding the paths: they must include a slash at the end (backslash for Linux & Apple users, frontslash for Windows users).
